## Part Two - User Personas and Use Cases

### **Primary user groups**

We differentiate two primary user groups:

1. **Cross-platform gamers**. 
    This group of potential users often has a problem with managing their libraries. It is for a good reason: if they have, for example, 600 games among 5 different platforms, it's not as easy as "you bought it, you should know where it is". Especially nowadays, when the number of games being given away for free or insanely cheap is at an all-time high with Amazon Prime Gaming, Epic Games Store, and even GOG as of late. Thus, the tool that gives the user an easy way to check their libraries with just one launcher will help save a lot of time, as well as prevent needless purchases.

2. **Players looking for bargains**. Lots of players just want to buy a game at its most attractive price, even if they don't usually use multiple platforms. They will certainly benefit from the OG Searcher's feature that gives the user the ability to compare prices of games on different launchers and to check the game's price history. Comparing prices is a good way to find the best place to buy any given game, while checking the price history is a great feature for deciding whether or not now is a good time to make a purchase.

### Summary and use cases

To summarize, we differentiate three different primary use cases:

1. **Managing cross-platform libraries**; users will be able to add their accounts to our system and then compare their libraries. This will make it easy to find all of their games. 
2. **Finding the most affordable way of buying a game at the given moment**; users will be able to check a chosen game's price across different platforms. This will give them the ability to make smarter purchases.
3. **Checking the price history of games**; when users choose a game they will be able to see its price history, the historical lows, etc. This will allow them to see if it's a smart choice to buy the game at the moment.
