# OG Search - Open Game Search

## Part One - Project Vision and Scope

### **The Idea**

The idea behind the project is to incorporate two main utilities:

1. **A multi-library aggregator** for people that use multiple gaming launchers and platforms.
2. **A price comparer** to give users an easy way to check the price history and availability of the games.

### **The Library Aggregator Side**

This part might be significantly more niche, but it is just as important as the price comparer. As some players use a lot of different gaming platforms, like Steam, GOG, Epic Games, Xbox PC Launcher, itch.io, etc., they might need a way to easily find their games.

> Speaking from experience, this can become quite a burden, especially nowadays because many companies give away free games (Epic Games, for instance) or monthly in subscription (Amazon Prime Gaming or Humble Choice). This causes, in our opinion, a bizarre situation, where it's actually quite easy to forget if and where we have a given game.

That is why we want to make one platform where players can connect or link all of their accounts, so that finding all the games becomes easy. The platform can also serve other purposes, such as comparing prices and availability on different platforms. This is where the other side of our project comes in.

### **The Price Comparer Side**

While a platform that shows users where they own certain games might appeal to many, we believe just as many won't need this feature. Therefore, OG Search will serve two additional purposes.

> The first one is to compare prices of different games between platforms and to check the price history of a certain game. We think that almost all gamers will benefit from such a feature, as most of us usually want to buy something at its best price.

> The second one is to check the availability of games on different platforms. This is similar to the price comparer, but it is necessary. A lot of the time, we just want to check if a game is even available on any platform, as there are a lot of niche and indie games that might be hard to find. A feature like that will make it easier to make educated purchases.

### **Goals and Objectives**

- Our main goal is to make buying games easier and more fun. We want to make a comprehensive platform that gives gamers an easier way to manage their virtual libraries and make more educated purchases.

- Our target audience is people who play video games and constantly want to discover and purchase new ones. Our main target audience is players with huge libraries and wishlists.

- Our primary objective is to implement a platform that meets all of our features and goals listed above. Users will be able to link all of their gaming accounts and check the availability, price of a game and whether or not they already have a given game.

### **Non-goals**

- As to what will not be included in this project, we have no intention of implementing our own proprietary shop, and thus any function of directly downloading games from the app. This is because of two things:

  1. Firstly, it would greatly increase the scale and difficulty of the project, which is not our intention.

  2. Secondly, we really don't see a point in doing that. We want to make PC gaming easier and more convenient, not just add another launcher that users will forget about.

- Our goal is not intended to create a big, casual user-friendly platform. These people are obviously welcome as well, but we do not intend to make changes for that group exactly.
