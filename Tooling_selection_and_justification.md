## Part Three - Tooling Selection and Justification

### List of Tools We Will Use and Their Purposes
1. **Frontend: React.js** - for creating the graphical user interface.
2. **Mobile App: React Native** - to develop a lightweight, easily portable mobile app.
3. **Database and Backend: Supabase** - for ease of hosting and development, with PostgreSQL.
4. **Styling: Tailwind CSS** - for styling the website and mobile app.
5. **Hosting: Vercel** - for hosting the frontend.

### Justification of Each Tool
- **React.js**: We want to use React.js due to its large community, which makes it easier to learn and adopt the framework. This enables rapid development of the app and website while minimizing technological debt.

- **React Native**: We choose React Native because of its good compatibility with React.js through React Native for Web solutions. In our opinion, it is the simplest and most viable way to develop a mobile app for our purposes.

- **Supabase**: We selected Supabase due to its beginner-friendly approach and strong support for PostgreSQL.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind works well with React and accelerates the styling process compared to options like SCSS.

- **Vercel**: We chose Vercel primarily because of its seamless integration with Supabase and its numerous built-in features for frontend security.

### How the Tools Complement Each Other
As mentioned above, all of our chosen tools integrate well with each other. Vercel works seamlessly with Supabase and React, while Tailwind CSS simplifies frontend development when paired with React. Together, these tools create a cohesive and efficient development environment.
