## Part Three - Tooling Selection and Justification

### List of tools we will use and their purposes
1. **Frontend: React.js** for creating the graphical user interface.
2. **Creating mobile app: React native** to make a lightweight, easily portable mobile app.
3. **Database and backend: Firebase** to easily make and maintain backend with noSQL database.
4. **Styling: TailwindCSS** for styling the website and mobile app.
5. **Hosting: Google Cloud** for hosting the entire project.

### Justification of each tool
- We want to use React.js due to its large community that makes it easier to get to know the framework well, and thus develop the app and website quickly, without making too much technological debt.

- We choose react native due to its good compatibility with react.js in react native for web solutions. It's also, in our opinion, the simplest viable way for making a mobile app for our purposes. 

- We want to use Firebase as it will be easy for us to learn it due to its BaaS nature. We also think that using JSON files in noSQL database will be perfect for our needs.

- Tailwind works well with React, and speeds up the styling process in comparison with options like SCSS.

- Choosing google cloud was probably the most obvious option here, as it is kind of the only possible choice with firebase, due to them both being google products.

### How the tools complement each other
As mentioned above, all of our chosen tools work well with each other. There will be no problems with compatibility.
